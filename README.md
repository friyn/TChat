TChat is a full-featured messaging platform that combines traditional chat functionality with artificial intelligence to create a more dynamic communication experience. The application allows users to chat with other people in real-time while also offering an integrated AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini API.

What makes TChat special is its combination of traditional messaging with an AI assistant that can be customized to fit specific needs. Whether you need help with information, want to brainstorm ideas, or just have a friendly conversation, the AI assistant adapts to your preferences.

## üéØ How TChat Works

TChat uses Firebase for its backend infrastructure, providing reliable real-time data synchronization and user authentication. The front end is built with React for a responsive and dynamic user interface.

The AI assistant functionality integrates Google's Generative AI (Gemini) to provide intelligent and contextual responses. The AI's behavior can be customized by modifying configuration values in the Firebase database, allowing admins to change the AI's personality without updating the application code.

The announcement system similarly allows for dynamic content updates without requiring code changes. Administrators can push new announcements that appear for all users until dismissed.

- **Seamless AI Integration**: The AI assistant feels like a natural part of the chat experience
- **Advanced Code Handling**: Share code with proper syntax highlighting and a copy button
- **Available Everywhere**: Use on the web or download the Android application
